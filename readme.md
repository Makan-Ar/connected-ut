## Connected UT

ConnectedUT is an online platform developed for the University of Toledo's students where they can list their textbooks that they purchased for previous classes, for other students to buy. The textbooks can be listed based on the instructor and/or the course that they were purchased for, which makes it very easy for students to find exactly what they are looking for.
